# CodeBook

This is a codebook for the final result - result.txt

## Background

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

This means the final result will have 30 volunteers x 6 activities = 180 records and 68 columns (subject_id, activity, and 66 average statistics). We'll discuss this dataset below.

## Variables

The activity variable (factor) contains six actions as presented in the below table.

|id |	activity |

| 1	| WALKING |
| 2	| WALKING_UPSTAIRS |
