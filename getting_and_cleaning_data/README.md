# Getting and Clearning Data Course Project

Hello friends, this is my repo for the final course project of Getting and Clearning Data by Johns Hopkins University. I performed five steps to clean this dataset http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Note - First, I merged datasets (train, test, subject) and labelled them before extracting target columns with regular expressions.

## Software

R version 3.5.2 and RStudio version 1.1.456

## Package Installation

Two main packages I used for this assignment - dplyr and stringr. Both are very powerful for data & string manipulation.

## Final Result

The final result (csv file) was also uploaded on this repo. You can check it here https://github.com/toyeiei/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/getting_and_cleaning_data/result.csv.
